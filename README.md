# FGO Material Simulator Select All Servants
Userscript that adds a "Select All" button to the [FGO Material Simulator](http://fgosim.github.io/Material/) servant selector under the Inventory (EN) / My Chaldea (JP) / 所持アイテム (JP) dialogue which automates clicking on every servant icon manually. Avoids having to individually select all 100+ servants on your account. Tested with Tampermonkey on Firefox.
